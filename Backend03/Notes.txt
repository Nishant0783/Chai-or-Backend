# I have made a temp folder which will be ignoreed by git so to add to folder to my repository I have made a empty file .gitkeep inside temp folder which forces git to keep track of temp folder also.

# I have installed nodemon here but as dev dependency. So dev dependency means that the package is only used through thr development process, we do not take it to production.
If we use command 'npm install --save-dev nodemon' or 'npm install -D nodemon' it will installed as dev dependency otherwise using normal command it will installed as main dependency.
